      "Summary: A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\n",
      "The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Transformer (deep learning architecture)\n",
      "Summary: The transformer is a deep learning architecture that was developed by researchers at Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\n",
      "Transformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Attention Is All You Need\n",
      "Summary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, and a main contributor to the AI boom, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of a wide variety of AI, such as large language models. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique's potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\n",
      "The paper's title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper's authors, liked the sound of that word.\n",
      "An early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\n",
      "Some early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Encoder-Decoder Attention:** The Transformer uses multi-head attention in \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers. In this setup, queries originate from the previous decoder layer, while memory keys and values come from the encoder's output. This allows each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence, mimicking typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms.\n",

      "*   **Self-Attention for Interpretability:** The document suggests that self-attention can lead to more interpretable models. By inspecting attention distributions, the authors found that individual attention heads learn to perform different tasks, and many exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Examples of Attention Heads:** The document includes examples of attention heads involved in tasks like following long-distance dependencies (e.g., \"making...more difficult\") and anaphora resolution (identifying what \"its\" refers to). These examples illustrate how attention mechanisms can capture relationships between words in a sentence.\n",
